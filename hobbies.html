      <p>Games, games, games! No doubt many (if not all of you) also play video games. I love video games, ever since I was a child and my parents bought me a NES, Ive been hooked. Now a days, most of my video games are on my PC but I still own a Nintendo Switch for console games. My current list of games that I try to play weekly are:
        <ol>
          <li>Genshin Impact</li>
          <li>Apex Legends</li>
          <li>Fortnite</li>
          <li>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius: War of the Visions</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
      </p>

      <p>I also am interested in tabletop games. I used to play D&D and Vampire: The Masquerade when I was younger. And although I do not play these any longer, I urge others to give em a try to experience role-playing in a tabletop setting. These days my tabletop games are more army war based rather than adventuring parties. I have sizable armies for the following games:
        <ol>
          <li>Warhammer 40,000 - Deathguard (rules!)</li>
          <li>Warmachine and Hordes - Retribution of Scyrah</li>
          <li>Warcaster: Neo-Mechanika - Iron Star Alliance</li>
          </ol>
      Sadly, I am way behind on painting my minatures and do not have anything presentable I can post here yet :(</p><br>

      <p>I also enjoy reading books and manga (Japanese comics). While I mostly just read the mangas of certain series, I also occasionally watch some of the more popular animes such as Boku No Hero Academia. As for books themselves, I tend to read in the Sci-fi/Fantasy genres. Some of my all time favorites include (but hardly limited to!):
        <ul>
          <li>Dune</li>
          <li>Wheel of Time</li>
          <li>Sword of Truth</li>
          <li>The Unbeliver</li>
          <li>and so many more...</li>
        </ul>

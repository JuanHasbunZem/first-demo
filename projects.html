      <p>Here is a list of all the projects I have worked on at Epicodus (and actually uploaded to Github). Many of them are incomplete, or very basic and barebones. These projects were more about me learning the concepts and syntaxs of the langauge rather than completly building a working program.
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/JuanHasbunZem/hello-world">Hello-World.</a>  This is just a basic HTML page that says Hello to the World in several different langauges as well as my first attempt at using Githubs repository.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/JuanHasbunZem/goodbye">Goodbye.</a> This project was for me to better understand how the git add and git commit functions worked for github.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/JuanHasbunZem/cookie-recipe">Cookie-Recipe.</a> I used this project to learn how git clone worked and then modified an already existing HTML file and learned the usage of some of the core html tags (such as p h a ul and ol)</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/JuanHasbunZem/branching-test-project">Branch Test Project</a>  This project was a simple html text that I used to practice and learn how the git branch command works.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/JuanHasbunZem/my-first-webpage">My first webpage</a> While it is called my first webpage, this is really just a fake page that I used to learn the basics of CSS styles, README files, and reinforcing the HTML basics I have learned thus far.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/JuanHasbunZem/using_floats">Using Floats</a> A html page about walrus' that I used to learn how to create a sidebar using CSS.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/JuanHasbunZem/moar-css-practice">Moar CSS Practice</a> This is an incomplete HTML page that I created to mess around with a few CSS styles to get a better hang of how some of the css commands worked together. </li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/JuanHasbunZem/first-demo">First Demo</a> The webpage you are currently viewing. This is my first attempt at trying to demonstrate everything Ive learned so far about GIT, CSS, and HTML at Epicodus thus far.</li>

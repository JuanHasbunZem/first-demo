      <p>Hello Visitor! I'm Juan Hasbun, and welcome to my About Me page!  I was born in California on Sept 1, 1982 and was raised in Cali for the first 17 years of my life along with my family (Dad, Mom, 2 younger sisters, and 2 younger brothers) before we moved up to Oregon. Since then, I have briefly lived in Wyoming, Vancouver (Canada) and California throughout the years but always came back to Oregon.</p>
      <p>Both of my parents are immigrants from El Salvador however, I have always considered myself to be 100% American (and would rarely call out that I am El Salvadorian aside from accuracies sake) even with the shame of recent events.</p>
      <p>Despite my parents both being Roman Catholics, I am thankful that they decided to raise us as free from religion as they possibly could - to allow us to decide what we do or do not believe in.  As such I consider myself to be Agnostic, I cannot prove or disprove in an entity called God, but I refuse to believe that Humans are the pinnacle of the Universes' evolution and so <em>must</em> acknowledge that a Being (<strong>or group of</strong>) had or continues to exist.</p>
      <p>All seriousness aside, I consider myself to be a laid back, and analytical type of person. I am more comfortable staring at a problem and thinking through various scenarios to look for a solution. This is one of the reasons I am excited to attend Epicodus, it will hopefully make me "break out of my shell" and make it easier to work out problems with others instead of just working on it by myself.</p>
